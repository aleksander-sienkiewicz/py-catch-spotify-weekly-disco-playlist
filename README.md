# py catch spotify weekly disco playlist
Uses Spoitify api to catch songs from users weekly discovery playlist and automatically adds it to a new playlist so that the user doesnt miss it. 
User logs in to app once, then doesnt have to authenticate after that
This is ran on http://127.0.0.1:5000/saveDiscoverWeekly


We can run this serverlessly using lambda. we can set it up to call once a week and you will never miss ur discovered weekly playlist again.

this project built on the last one rlly well, liked using python so much more than rust.
